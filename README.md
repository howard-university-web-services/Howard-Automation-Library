# Howard Automation Library (HAL)

This repo holds bash scripts and other files to help in the automation of Howard University Drupal projects.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your ~/Sites folder, as "_hal"

- `$ cd ~/Sites`
- `$ git clone https://https://github.com/howard-university-web-services/Howard-Automation-Library.git _hal`

### Add Local Config

- `$ cd ~/Sites/_hal`
- `$ cp hal_config.default.txt hal_config.txt`
- Edit hal_config.txt to use the absolute path to any local Howard D8 repos you wish to update/use.
- Edit hal_config.txt to use the local drush aliases you have.

#### Finding your local Howard D8 folders

- LOCAL_HOWARD_D8_FOLDERS[0] = Your local hud8 root folder.
- LOCAL_HOWARD_D8_FOLDERS[1] = Your local academicdepartments root folder.
- Navigate to your DevDesktop sites folder.
- Find the folder you wish to use, ie "hud8-dev"
- `cd hud8-dev`
- `pwd`: The out put of this would go into hal_config.txt as `LOCAL_HOWARD_D8_FOLDERS[0]="/PATH/TO/YOUR/FOLDER/hud8-dev"` (NOTICE THE "0" HERE).
- Subsequent paths, Academic Departments,for additional Howard D8 environments you wish to update would go into hal_config.txt as `LOCAL_HOWARD_D8_FOLDERS[1]="/PATH/TO/YOUR/OTHER/FOLDER/academicdepartments-dev"` (NOTICE THE "1" HERE).

#### Finding your local drush aliases

- Run `drush sa` for a list of current drush aliases.
- You should see `@cl.prod_academicdepartments.dev.dev` and `@cl.prod_hud8.dev.dev`, with others for stg and prod installs of each. These would be added as `@cl.prod_academicdepartments`, leaving off the env connotation, as we set that in a choice per script, so that you may choose in the script which env to run them on.

### Requirements

Be sure the following are up and running correctly on your local machine:

- [Acquia DevDesktop](https://www.acquia.com/drupal/acquia-dev-desktop)
- [Drush](https://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/) -- Already present if using DevDesktop

## Updating HAL

Use git to keep this library up date on your local machine.

- `cd ~/Sites/_hal`
- `git pull`

## Usage

- Ensure you are in the proper folder, if the script requires it, especially for partials
- `$ sh your_desired_script.sh`
- Do not use sudo

## Drupal 8

The following full scripts are available:

### Acquia

#### Initial spin-up of a multi-site site, and clone dev.coasdept

- This script creates a new multi-site install locally (copies the _starter_ folder), adjusts settings.php and sites.php with needed parameters, adds connection data to a multi-site DB on acquia, Commits to master, and pushes to Acquia. The script then clones the dev.coasdept.howard.edu DB and Files into it, directly on acquia DEV. A video overview can be seen on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/400050607/0f830ca20d).

##### Manual Steps (to be completed first)

- Create database in desired environment (hud8 or academicdepartments), and note machine name.
- Add URLs for new site into dev/stg/live URL fields in acquia.

##### Automated Steps (done by script after manual steps complete)

- Be sure that HAL is up to date.
- Be sure that all desired local folders, and drush aliases are set up in hal_config.txt.
- Be sure that you are on master branch, and it is up to date.
- Be sure you have the database machine name you added in acquia.
- You will need to keep a loose eye on the terminal to put in passwords/etc occasionally.
- `$ sh ~/Sites/_hal/drupal/acquia/create_new_multisite.sh`

#### Update all Howard packagist repos, on all Howard D8 sites, commit, and push to acquia

- Be sure that HAL is up to date.
- Be sure that all desired local folders are set up in hal_config.txt.
- Be sure that you are on master branch, and it is up to date.
- You will need to keep a loose eye on the terminal to put in passwords/etc occasionally.
- `$ sh ~/Sites/_hal/drupal/acquia/update_howard_packages.sh`

#### Update the twitter API key on all sites

- Be sure that HAL is up to date.
- Be sure that all desired local drush aliases are set up in hal_config.txt.
- Be sure that you are on master branch, and it is up to date.
- You may set twitter credentials in hal_config.txt and simply hit enter through the prompts, or paste them in as the prompts arise.
- You will need to keep a loose eye on the terminal to put in passwords/etc occasionally.
- `$ sh ~/Sites/_hal/drupal/acquia/update_twitter_api_key.sh`

#### Update database on all acquia D8 sites

- Be sure that HAL is up to date.
- Be sure that all desired local drush aliases are set up in hal_config.txt.
- Be sure all acquia drush aliases are up to date.
- You may choose either hud8 or academicdepartments. The script then runs drush updb on all multi-sites on dev, stg, and prod.
- You will need to keep a loose eye on the terminal to put in passwords/etc occasionally.
- `$ sh ~/Sites/_hal/drupal/acquia/update_db_on_acquia.sh`

## Roadmap

### All Howard D8 acquia codebases

- Run composer add on all local codebases. "add the seckit module on all local D8 codebases" **In Progress**
- Commit and push to DEV for all local codebases
- Deploy to prod for all codebases
